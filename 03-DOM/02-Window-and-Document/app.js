// window object = browser api, provides way to work with browser
// by providing various methods and properties

// document = window.document, we need not to write window.document every time because of the nature of javascript, if JS does not find a object of the given name it will look in the global window object

// console.dir = shows properties and methods
console.dir(document);
// as opposed to html structure we wrote
console.log(document);
